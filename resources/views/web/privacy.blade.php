   <h3> Website Cookies </h3>
   <p> Some of the information that we collect will not personally identify you but will instead track your use of our website so that we can better understand how our website is used by end users and in turn enhance and improve your experience in using our website. This information can be obtained through the use of cookies. Cookies are a small data file transferred to your device that recognises and identifies your device and allows your device to 'remember' information from our website for future use. We may collect technical information from your web browser or mobile device or your use of our services through a web browser or mobile device, for example, location data and certain characteristics of, and performance data about your device, carrier/operating system including device and connection type and IP address. Unless you have elected to remain anonymous through your device and/or the web browser, the above mentioned information may be collected and used by us automatically through your use of our website. </p>
   <p> Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information with third parties, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to facilitate the display of targeted advertising. </p>

   <p> You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies, including for advertising. </p>

   <ul>
      <li> Although most browsers and devices accept cookies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear or decline cookies. If you disable cookies, however, some of the features of our website may not function properly. </li>
      <li> To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google’s opt-out browser add-on by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. </li>

      <li> If you are using your mobile device, check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device. For example, on your iOS device, enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting, and on your Android device, enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting.
      Our websites do not respond to Do Not Track signals because we do not track our users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising. However, we believe that you should have a choice regarding interest-based ads served by our partners, which is why we outline the options available to you above. </li>
   </ul>
